WRP is a HTTP proxy service that renders the web page in to a GIF/JPEG image associated with clickable imagemap of the original web links. It allows to use historical and obsolete web browsers on the modern web. It's still a work in progress but it's quite stable and usable for casual web browsing.

WRP supports Mac OS X and Linux. It requires Python 2.7 and under Linux, PyQT4.
